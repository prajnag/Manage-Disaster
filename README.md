# Manage-Disaster
Idea Submission for Codefundo- Better management of the aftermath of a Natural Disaster.

We have two ideas using which we can improve the efficiency of communication during the aftermath of a natual disaster.

We have noticed that in many cases, people are willing to contribute resources, but it doesnt reach the intended places.  
The first one is a logistics app, which benefits those who want to volunteer and those affected. For the volunteers, they can fill up a form with a preference as to where they would like to help out, and people can contribute some money for the purpose as well. Our team will sit down and analyse how we can distribute the volunteers amongst the shelter camps for a more efficient and smoother running of things. We will analyse the needs of every shelter camp separately, taking into consideration the number of people, and number of children so we can allocate the resources accordingly, and they dont go to waste or end up in the wrong hands. These volunteers should have some basic skills such as how to use a radio, or first aid, and they can subsequently teach the victims in the affected area such skill.
We can also tie up with some companies like Swiggy and Uber to make delivery of items possible.

Our second idea is to use the same technology that emergency numbers use. In many parts of the world, an emergency service can identify the telephone number that a call has been placed from. For landline users, the location can be found by looking up their physical address in a database and for mobile users, GPS is generally used.
Using this approach, we would like to add a people finder option on the application for the benefit of the families of those who are affected. Also, the person concerned can submit some more personal details on the platform provided to him by us( either an app or a website) so that identification and location becomes easier.

We can also us amateur radio emergency communications (which only require solar power or automobile batteries to power up) to further improve the efficiency of this idea.  Amateur Radio operators and enthusiasts are also trying to use solar powered amateur radio stations which may proe to be extremely helpful in many situations. Those who are particularly interested in the in this hobby usually affiliate with an organized group for disaster specific training. Therefore, in our app, we plan on training the volunteers with basic knowledge of amateur radio before sending them out to the disaster affected region.
