# Manage-Disaster
Idea Submission for Codefundo

We have two ideas using which we can improve the efficiency of communication during the aftermath of a natual disaster. 
We have noticed that in many cases, people are willing to contribute resources, but it doesnt reach the intended places.  
The first one is a logistics app, which benefits those who want to volunteer and those affected. For the volunteer, they can fill up a form with a preference as to where they would like to help out, and people can contribute some money for the purpose as well. Our team will sit down and analyse how we can distribute the volunteers among the shelter camps for a more efficient and smoother running of things. We can also tie up with some companies like Swiggy and Uber to make delivery of items possible.
